# Natural Disaster Prediction Model: PREDINA
*Group project developed for a university course. My contribution included data cleaning, analysis, and reporting.*
## Overview

This project, part of the IT362 - Principles of Data Science course, analyzes the patterns, financial impacts, and trends of natural disasters from 1900 to 2021. Our goal is to enhance disaster preparedness through data-driven insights.

## Motivations 
While natural disasters may not always be preventable, early warning indicators can significantly mitigate losses and enhance protection measures. This study aims to deepen the understanding of natural disasters, focusing on proactive strategies to help minimize their impact and improve preparedness.

## Data Sources

- **EM-DAT**: The International Disaster Database.
- **Kaggle Dataset**:ALL NATURAL DISASTERS 1900-2025 / EOSDIS.
- **GDACS**: Real-time alerts and data on disasters.

## Objectives

- Identify factors influencing disaster impacts.
- Analyze affected regions by disaster type.
- Estimate losses and assess earthquake probabilities.

## Methodology

We employ various techniques, including correlation analysis, geospatial analysis, regression analysis, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract insights from the data.
